# A-Text-Based-Game-with-Solution
A text based version of Silent Knight by Niels Højgaard Sørensen.
In this game there are limited actions (Open, Look At, Pick Up, Misbehave, Talk To) and limited objects.
The game starts with our character standing in the prison cell. He should trick the guard, go to the toilet, trick the guard again and finally bribe the floor guards to escape from the prison.
Benefiting from the stack data structure and DFS algorithm to find a way out without any user input.
